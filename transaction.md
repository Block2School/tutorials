# What's a transaction

A transaction is an agreement between a buyer and a seller, a supplier and a consumer, or a provider and a consumer that there will be an exchange of assets, products, or services for currency, cryptocurrency, or some other asset, either in the present or in the future. Ethereum helps in executing the transaction. Following are the three types of transactions that can be executed in Ethereum:

- Transfer of Ether from one account to another: The accounts can be externally owned accounts or contract accounts. Following are the possible cases:
    - An externally owned account sending Ether to another externally owned account in a transaction
    - An externally owned account sending Ether to a contract account in a transaction
    - A contract account sending Ether to an externally owned account in a transaction
- Deployment of a smart contract: An externally owned account can deploy a contract using a transaction in EVM.
- Using or invoking a function within a contract: Executing a function in a contract that changes state is considered a transaction in Ethereum. If executing a function does not change a state, it does not require a transaction.
