# Arrays

Arrays are used to store collections of data of the same type. This tutorial introduces the concept of arrays in C++ and demonstrates how to declare, initialize, and use arrays. It's a fundamental concept for working with collections of data.

## It's your turn

Create a program that finds the sum of elements in an array. Declare an integer array numbers with values ({2, 4, 6, 8, 10}). Write a function calculateSum to compute the sum of the elements and then print the result.


Expected output : 
The sum of the elements is: 30
