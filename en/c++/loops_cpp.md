# Loops

Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly. This tutorial covers the for loop, a common type of loop in C++. It demonstrates how to use a loop to perform iterative tasks, such as printing multiples of a number.

## It's your turn

Create a program that prints the first 5 multiples of a given number. Declare a variable baseNumber and assign it a value. Use a for loop to calculate and print the multiples.

Expected output: 
3 x 1 = 3
3 x 2 = 6
3 x 3 = 9
3 x 4 = 12
3 x 5 = 15
