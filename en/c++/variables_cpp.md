# Variables

Variables are fundamental in programming, allowing you to store and manipulate data. This tutorial covers how to declare variables, assign values to them, and introduces basic data types in C++ such as integers (int) and strings (std::string).


## It's yourn turn

Declare an integer variable named myNumber, assign it a value of 42, and print the value to the console.

Empty code :

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Declare the variable and assign a value here

    std::cout << "The value of myNumber is: " << myNumber << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Expected output : 
The value of myNumber is: 42

Expected answer: 
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Declare the variable and assign a value here
    int myNumber = 42;

    // Fill in the blank here to print the value
    std::cout << "The value of myNumber is: " << myNumber << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
