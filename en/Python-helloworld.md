# Hello World!

Welcome to the tutorials in the Python language! These tutorials will help you understand the basics of a programming language so that you can be prepared for more complex tutorials.

## Function

The foundation of a language like Python is functions. To execute a program, you need to do it within a function, which is a way to group multiple actions together.

Here is an example of a function in Python:

```python
def my_function():
    # some code
```

A function is defined by the keyword `def` followed by the name of the function and parentheses. The parentheses are used to pass parameters to the function, but we will see that later.

## print

The `print` function is used to display a message in the terminal. Here is an example:

```python
print("My message")
```

The message should be placed between quotes. The quotes should be either single or double quotes: (`'` or `"`).

> **Note:** The `print` function can take several parameters. To separate them, you must use a comma (`,`).

> **Note:** Don't forget to call the function to execute it. (If you choose to create a function)

## It's your turn

Display the message "**Hello World!**" in the terminal.
