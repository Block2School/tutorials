# Simple Print function in Javascript

-------

The simple way to print in the terminal or stdout in javascript is the following function:

```js
console.log();
```

The best thing about this function is that it allows you to print nearly everything in JavaScript, be it Strings, Numbers, Objects ...

What we want to do today is make a function that allows us to print (we will do a function called `print` that encapsulate the `console.log` function.

1. Create a function named `print`.
2. The function should take a single argument (ℹ️ The name of the argument is not important ℹ️)
3. The function should print the object taken as argument.

Here's the starting code:

⚠️ Do NOT remove the lines already written or the code WON'T work ⚠️

-----

```js
const print = (/*argument*/) => {
  // code here
};

print("Simple print");
```

> ℹ️ Your function should print `Simple print` when submitting your code ! ℹ️
