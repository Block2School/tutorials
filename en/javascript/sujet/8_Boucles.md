# Loops

Now, let's explore loops in JavaScript, specifically the for loops.

## How to Create a for Loop

A for loop is written like this:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    // Your code here
}
```

A for loop allows you to define a variable, modify it at each iteration, and stop only when the condition is met.

## Example

Here's an example:
```js
const testFor = () => {
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        console.log(i);
    }
};
testFor();
```

## It's your turn

Display all elements from a list using a for loop.
Tip: Use the length of the list.
