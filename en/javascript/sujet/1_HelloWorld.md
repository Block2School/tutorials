# Hello World!

Welcome to tutorials in the JavaScript language! These tutorials will help you understand the basics of a programming language so that you can be prepared for more complex tutorials, especially in Solidity.

## Function

The foundation of a language like JavaScript is functions. To execute a program, you need to do it within a function, which is a way to group multiple actions together.

A function can be created in different ways. Here's one:

```js
const myFunction = () => {
    // Your code here
};
myFunction();
```

A function is declared as a **variable**. A **variable** is like a box where you can store various things like **_text, a number, or even a function_** as shown here. The parentheses are simply the beginning of the function; we can put parameters in there later. The arrow **=>** points to the curly braces. Inside the braces, you can put your **actions**, like the ones we're going to learn in this tutorial.

## console.log

This action allows you to display a message in the command terminal. You call it like this:

```js
console.log("My message");
```

Your message must be enclosed in single or double quotes (`"` or `'`). Each **action** must end with a `;`.

## It's your turn

Display the message "**Hello World!**" in the terminal.
