# Addition

Now that you know how to display a message, let's proceed to perform a calculation and display it in the terminal.

## Variable

A variable can be declared like this:

```js
const myVariable = 0;
```

Here, we have created a variable named `myVariable` which is set to `0`.

## Calculation

You can perform calculations just like in mathematics. Here are the **different operators** that exist:

```js
let myNumber = 0; // We'll talk about the "let" keyword in a future tutorial

myNumber = 1 + 1 // = 2 => Addition
myNumber = 5 - 2 // = 3 => Subtraction
myNumber = 5 * 2 // = 10 => Multiplication
myNumber = 5 / 2 // = 2.5 => Division
myNumber = 5 % 2 // = 1 => Remainder of an integer division
```

## It's your turn

Create a variable that calculates the value **28**. _You can choose any operation for the calculation_, only the result is **mandatory**. Then, **display the value in the terminal**.
