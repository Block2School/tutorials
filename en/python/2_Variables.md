# Variables

Variables are an important part of any programming language.

## Variable types

To define a variable, you can do as follows:

```python
number = 1 # Number variable
float = 5.10 # Decimal number variable
text = "Hello !" # Variable text
boolean = False # Boolean variable
listing = ["Value", 1, None] # Listing variable (more on this later)
objectDict = {"key": "value"} # Dictionary variable (more on this later)
```

## It's your turn

Complete the functions.
