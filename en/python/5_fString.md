# F-String

The f-string is a simple way of putting variables into a string.

## Usage

To create an f-string, simply put an `f` in front of your string.  
Here's an example:  

```python
number = 15
print(f"My number is {number}") # Will display the text: "My number is 15".
```

`{number}` has taken the value of the variable `number`.
