# Hello World!

Welcome to the tutorials in the C language! These tutorials will guide you through the fundamentals of C programming, starting with basic concepts and gradually progressing to more advanced topics.

In C, the traditional first program is the "Hello, World!" program. This simple program prints the message "Hello, World!" to the console. This is useful tips to make it 

- include <stdio.h>: This line includes the standard input/output library, which provides functions like printf.

- int main(): This line declares the main function. In C, the program execution starts from the main function.

- {}: These curly braces enclose the body of the main function.

- printf("Hello, World!\n");: This line uses the printf function to print the "Hello, World!" message to the console. The \n represents a newline character, which moves the cursor to the next line.

- return 0;: This line indicates the successful execution of the program. The 0 is returned to the operating system.

## It's your turn

Display the message "**Hello World!**" in the terminal.


```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Display "Hello World!" here
    return 0;
}
```

Expected output : 
Hello World
